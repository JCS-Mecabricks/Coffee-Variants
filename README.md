## Coffee Variants

**There are 5 types of coffees: mocha, latte, espresso, cappuccino, and regular coffee.
There is also a food called Affogato and a block called Coffee Station.**

All coffees are craftable. The only coffee crafted in a specific order except for espresso

 When consuming espresso, you get an effect called caffeine which makes you super fast and makes you jump high

Coffee Station is crafted with any type of planks except crismon and warped

Affogato is not craftable, it is only obtainable by a barista villager
